        With another year almost gone, it's time for those endless retrospectives lists! But for this year I want to make something different. After all, there is much more to look back in 12 months than a 100 song Spotify playlist. So I will go through some global topics and speak a little bit on each. Let's see what happens ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        2019 was my third year on Whitesmith, the first and only place to date where I worked so far. Everything I know about UX/UI, Front-end development and even project managment I own to them. 
        This year in particular I grown on an unexpected way, on something that was (and still is) one of my biggest flaws: Communication. I was put into test several times, leading directly with different clients instead of being just closed in my bubble. 
        <br><br>The real test of fire was when I was sent alone on a trip to London to meet with a client. I had been there before, but never alone. I not only managed to survive (effusive celebration) but to actually do what I had to with relative success.
        <br><br>On a more design side related, as a company, this summer we managed to do a so ambitioned redesign and refactor to Whitesmith website. Now we have something that reflects quite better what we are and what we can do.
        <br><br>As an individual, I managed to improve my knowledge of UI and Front-end, naturally. <a href="https://vuejs.org/" class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> became my Javascript framework of election, as I worked with it on a few projects, and as consequence forgot completely <a href="https://reactjs.org/" class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target="_blank">React</a> meanwhile.
        <br><br>Overall, with all the ups and downs, it was probably the year I grown up more since 2016.

        Oh boy, where to start. 2019 was a massive rollercoaster of everything. I think never had a so polarizing year.
        <br><br>For the first time, I went to live alone with my girlfriend. While it was a decision that made total sense, it didn't come without a truck of headaches. Finding a house on the budget and filling all our needs in an overly inflated market, signing contracts, pack things, unpack things, a classic.
        <br><br>In terms of trips, I did some. The most remarkable of all was the one to Belgium. I went to <a href="https://www.kikk.be/2019/en/home" class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target="_blank">Kikk Festival</a> in Namur, which was awesome (really good talks and exhibitions) and still had time to visit Brussels, which was not so awesome to be honest. Other trips and activities worth of mention: <a href="https://www.zigurfest.zigurartists.com/pt" class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target="_blank">Zigurfest</a> in Lamego on the second consecutive year (good music as usual, not so good camping park), a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6sHCvZe1PHrOAuYlwTLNH4?si=BmCj5wINQkqBA7dKwroQhg" class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target="_blank">Gus Dapperton</a> concert in Lisbon (very enjoyable), the <a href="https://pixels.camp/" class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target="_blank">Pixels Camp</a> Hackathon (also a usual trip, at least for me) and finally, WebSummit (not worth it).
        <br><br>I was also on the organization of <a href="../enemm" class="c-text--bold">ENEMM'19</a> helping on the branding and decoration of the event and more recently on GDG Coimbra's Devfest as a late time addition to the team, helping on the decoration as well.
        <br><br>Looking back, I managed to do a lot of stuff in quite few time, but that led to the thing I hated the most this year: the constant pressure of not having time to stop - there's always something to do, some shit that needs to be done or solved and if it's not, it would become a bigger problem later. All of this made me frustrated, irritated or sad more frequently than I used to.
        <br><br>It's quite difficult to say what I've could done better to avoid this, probably better time or expectations managment.

      <p class="c-text u-m-b-3x">To share the entertainment pieces that defined my year, I decided that a list of music albums, like I did last year (<a href="18of18" class="c-text--bold">The 18 of 18'</a>), wasn't enough. So I decided to make two more, one with my favourite and most played Videogames and another with the TV Shows that marked me the most during this year.
      <br><br>Stay tuned.</p>
