But for this year I wanted to make something different. After all, there is much more to look back in 12 months than a 100 song Spotify playlist.

Everything I know about UX/UI, Front-end development and even project managment I own to them. This year in particular I grown on an unexpected way, on something that was (and still is) one of my biggest flaws: Communication. I was put into test several times, leading directly with different clients instead of being just closed in my bubble.<br><br>The real test of fire was when I was sent alone on a trip to London to meet with a client. I had been there before, but never alone. I not only managed to survive (effusive celebration) but to actually do what I had to with relative success.<br><br>On a more design side related, as a company, this summer we managed to do a so ambitioned redesign and refactor to Whitesmith website. Now we have something that reflects quite better what we are and what we can do.<br><br>As an individual, I managed to improve my knowledge of UI and Front-end, naturally. <a href=https://vuejs.org/ class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target=_blank>Vue.js</a> became my Javascript framework of election, as I worked with it on a few projects, and as consequence forgot completely <a href=https://reactjs.org/ class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target=_blank>React</a> meanwhile.<br><br>Overall, with all the ups and downs, it was probably the year I grown up more since 2016.</div><div class="o-grid__el u-size-12/12 u-size-4/12@xs u-size-4/12@md u-p-v-3x"><figure><img class="c-image u-m-b-2x" src=../assets/images/2019/life-2019.jpg alt="Me at Kikk Festival"><figcaption class="c-text-note c-text-note--sm">The same young person now holding a belgian beer at Kikk Festival lounge area.

I think never had a so polarizing year.<br><br>For the first time, I went to live alone with my girlfriend. While it was a decision that made total sense, it didn't come without a truck of headaches. Finding a house on the budget and filling all our needs in an overly inflated market, signing contracts, pack things, unpack things, a classic.<br><br>In terms of trips, I did some. The most remarkable of all was the one to Belgium. I went to <a href=https://www.kikk.be/2019/en/home class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target=_blank>Kikk Festival</a> in Namur, which was awesome (really good talks and exhibitions) and still had time to visit Brussels, which was not so awesome to be honest. Other trips and activities worth of mention: <a href=https://www.zigurfest.zigurartists.com/pt class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target=_blank>Zigurfest</a> in Lamego on the second consecutive year (good music as usual, not so good camping park), a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6sHCvZe1PHrOAuYlwTLNH4?si=BmCj5wINQkqBA7dKwroQhg" class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target=_blank>Gus Dapperton</a> concert in Lisbon (very enjoyable), the <a href=https://pixels.camp/ class="c-text--bold external-click-js" target=_blank>Pixels Camp</a> Hackathon (also a usual trip, at least for me) and finally, WebSummit (not worth it).<br><br>I was also on the organization of <a href=../enemm class=c-text--bold>ENEMM'19</a> helping on the branding and decoration of the event and more recently on GDG Coimbra's Devfest as a late time addition to the team, helping on the decoration as well.<br><br>Looking back, I managed to do a lot of stuff in quite few time, but that led to the thing I hated the most this year: the constant pressure of not having time to stop - there's always something to do, some shit that needs to be done or solved and if it's not, it would become a bigger problem later. All of this made me frustrated, irritated or sad more frequently than I used to.<br><br>It's quite difficult to say what I've could done better to avoid this, probably better time or expectations managment.</div></section></article></main><div class=o-skeleton__head><footer class="o-container o-container--footer"><section class="o-section o-section--breathe-top u-p-b-0 o-grid"><div class="o-grid__el u-size-12/12 u-size-4/12@sm"><div class="u-hidden-@sm u-m-b"><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--sm" href=../index>home</a><p class="c-text-note c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm u-p-h">/</p><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--sm" href=../about>about</a><p class="c-text-note c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm u-p-h">/</p><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm" href=../contact>contact</a><p class="c-text-note c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm u-p-h">/</p><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm" href=../blog>blog</a></div><p class="c-text-note c-text-note--sm c-text-note--inline u-p-t">by João Marques . 2020</p><a href=../index><img class="c-image-footer c-image-footer--align-r u-hidden-@sm" src=../assets/images/jm_logo.svg></a></div><div class="o-grid__el u-size-12/12 u-size-5/12@sm u-visible-@sm u-p-t-1/2"><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--sm" href=../index>home</a><p class="c-text-note c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm u-p-h">/</p><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--sm" href=../about>about</a><p class="c-text-note c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm u-p-h">/</p><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm" href=../contact>contact</a><p class="c-text-note c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm u-p-h">/</p><a class="c-note-button c-text-note--inline c-text-note--sm" href=../blog>blog</a></div><div class="o-grid__el u-size-12/12 u-size-3/12@sm c-image-footer-container u-visible-@sm"><a href=../index><img class=c-image-footer src=../assets/images/jm_logo.svg></a></div></section></footer></div></div><script>var bodyjs = document.getElementsByClassName("body-js");
